| Hi! I see that you have some variables saved in your workspace. To keep things running smoothly, I
| recommend you clean up before starting swirl.

| Type ls() to see a list of the variables in your workspace. Then, type rm(list=ls()) to clear your
| workspace.

| Type swirl() when you are ready to begin.

| Whenever you're working with a new dataset, the first thing you should do is look at it! What is the
| format of the data? What are the dimensions? What are the variable names? How are the variables stored?
| Are there missing data? Are there any flaws in the data?

...

  |====                                                                                             |   4%

| This lesson will teach you how to answer these questions and more using R's built-in functions. We'll be
| using a dataset constructed from the United States Department of Agriculture's PLANTS Database
| (http://plants.usda.gov/adv_search.html).

...

  |========                                                                                         |   8%

| I've stored the data for you in a variable called plants. Type ls() to list the variables in your
| workspace, among which should be plants.

> 
> ls()
 [1] "%p%"             "boring_function" "cls_list"        "cls_vect"        "evaluate"       
 [6] "flag_colors"     "flag_shapes"     "flags"           "mad_libs"        "my_char"

[21] "tf"              "unique_vals"     "viewinfo"        "x"              

| You are really on a roll!

  |============                                                                                     |  12%

| Let's begin by checking the class of the plants variable with class(plants). This will give us a clue as
| to the overall structure of the data.

> class(plants)
[1] "data.frame"

| Your dedication is inspiring!

  |================                                                                                 |  16%

| It's very common for data to be stored in a data frame. It is the default class for data read into R
| using functions like read.csv() and read.table(), which you'll learn about in another lesson.

...

  |===================                                                                              |  20%

| Since the dataset is stored in a data frame, we know it is rectangular. In other words, it has two
| dimensions (rows and columns) and fits neatly into a table or spreadsheet. Use dim(plants) to see
| exactly how many rows and columns we're dealing with.

> dim(plants)
[1] 5166   10

| Keep up the great work!

  |=======================                                                                          |  24%

| The first number you see (5166) is the number of rows (observations) and the second number (10) is the
| number of columns (variables).

...

  |===========================                                                                      |  28%

| You can also use nrow(plants) to see only the number of rows. Try it out.

> nrow(plants)
[1] 5166

| Perseverance, that's the answer.

  |===============================                                                                  |  32%

| ... And ncol(plants) to see only the number of columns.

> ncol(plants)
[1] 10

| Perseverance, that's the answer.

  |===================================                                                              |  36%

| If you are curious as to how much space the dataset is occupying in memory, you can use
| object.size(plants).

> object.size(plants)
644232 bytes

| All that hard work is paying off!

  |=======================================                                                          |  40%

| Now that we have a sense of the shape and size of the dataset, let's get a feel for what's inside.
| names(plants) will return a character vector of column (i.e. variable) names. Give it a shot.

> names(plants)
 [1] "Scientific_Name"      "Duration"             "Active_Growth_Period" "Foliage_Color"       
 [5] "pH_Min"               "pH_Max"               "Precip_Min"           "Precip_Max"          
 [9] "Shade_Tolerance"      "Temp_Min_F"          

| Keep working like that and you'll get there!

  |===========================================                                                      |  44%

| We've applied fairly descriptive variable names to this dataset, but that won't always be the case. A
| logical next step is to peek at the actual data. However, our dataset contains over 5000 observations
| (rows), so it's impractical to view the whole thing all at once.

...

  |===============================================                                                  |  48%

| The head() function allows you to preview the top of the dataset. Give it a try with only one argument.

6         NA         NA            <NA>         NA

| All that practice is paying off!

  |==================================================                                               |  52%

| Take a minute to look through and understand the output above. Each row is labeled with the observation
| number and each column with the variable name. Your screen is probably not wide enough to view all 10
| columns side-by-side, in which case R displays as many columns as it can on each line before continuing
| on the next.

...

  |======================================================                                           |  56%

| By default, head() shows you the first six rows of the data. You can alter this behavior by passing as a
| second argument the number of rows you'd like to view. Use head() to preview the first 10 rows of
| plants.

| After previewing the top and bottom of the data, you probably noticed lots of NAs, which are R's
| placeholders for missing values. Use summary(plants) to get a better feel for how each variable is
| distributed and how much of the dataset is missing.

| summary() provides different output for each variable, depending on its class. For numeric data such as
| Precip_Min, summary() displays the minimum, 1st quartile, median, mean, 3rd quartile, and maximum. These
| values help us understand how the data are distributed.

...

  |======================================================================                           |  72%

| For categorical variables (called 'factor' variables in R), summary() displays the number of times each
| value (or 'level') occurs in the data. For example, each value of Scientific_Name only appears once,
| since it is unique to a specific plant. In contrast, the summary for Duration (also a factor variable)
| tells us that our dataset contains 3031 Perennial plants, 682 Annual plants, etc.

...

  |==========================================================================                       |  76%

| You can see that R truncated the summary for Active_Growth_Period by including a catch-all category
| called 'Other'. Since it is a categorical/factor variable, we can see how many times each value actually
| occurs in the data with table(plants$Active_Growth_Period).

| Perhaps the most useful and concise function for understanding the *str*ucture of your data is str().

| The beauty of str() is that it combines many of the features of the other functions you've already seen,
| all in a concise and readable format. At the very top, it tells us that the class of plants is
| 'data.frame' and that it has 5166 observations and 10 variables. It then gives us the name and class of
| each variable, as well as a preview of its contents.

...

  |=========================================================================================        |  92%

| str() is actually a very general function that you can use on most objects in R. Any time you want to
| understand the structure of something (a dataset, function, etc.), str() is a good place to start.

| In this lesson, you learned how to get a feel for the structure and contents of a new dataset using a
| collection of simple and useful functions. Taking the time to do this upfront can save you time and
| frustration later on in your analysis.
